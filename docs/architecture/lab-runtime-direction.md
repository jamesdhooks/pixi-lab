# Lab Runtime Direction

PIXILAB-6 moves Pixi Lab toward a browser Lab Runtime for games, simulations, ambients, overlays, and toys. PixiJS remains a first-class renderer backend, but it should no longer be treated as the whole platform identity.

## Runtime boundary

The Lab Runtime owns the host concerns that every experience shares:

- experience discovery and launch contracts through `LabExperience`;
- lifecycle, input, settings, demo/autoplay, idle behavior, and reset hooks;
- preview vs fullscreen/background rendering intent;
- backend/profile selection and sanitization before an experience is mounted;
- app-agnostic React shell behavior.

An experience owns its model, scene-specific adapters, renderer details, style manifest, settings, demo AI behavior, and validation evidence.

## Backend vs profile vocabulary

Use these terms for new architecture work:

- **Renderer backend**: the rendering implementation family, for example `pixi`, `webgl2`, `three`, or `webgpu`.
- **Render profile**: the budget/intent within a backend, for example `preview`, `standard`, or `high`.
- **Legacy render quality**: the existing `basic | enhanced | raw` selector that current scenes and routes still use while migration proceeds.

`raw` should not be treated as a global quality tier. If an experience needs a raw/high-powered route, expose it only through that experience's capabilities and route sanitization. Prefer describing future raw-like work as an explicit backend/profile pairing, such as `webgl2` + `high`, with a Pixi-safe preview fallback.

## Migration guardrails

- Do not rewrite the whole engine or switch the project wholesale to another framework.
- Do not globally expose raw mode.
- Do not promote scene-owned WebGL/WebGPU experiments into core until repeated implementation patterns prove the boundary.
- Keep Pixi as the default shared backend and preserve existing demo/gallery discovery while adding backend-neutral vocabulary.
- Add small pure helpers/types before runtime rewiring, then validate with focused package checks.

## Next smallest slice

Add a pure capability mapper that can translate existing `qualityModes` into backend/profile candidates for the host UI without changing scene behavior. It should preserve current raw scoping: unsupported experiences must still sanitize raw requests back to Pixi-safe defaults.
